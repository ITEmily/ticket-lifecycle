<p>
When an end user (customer) needs IT support help, they "create a ticket." The login page is http://localhost/os/Ticket/.  Here they can fill in the form to communicate the problem they are experiencing.

<p>
The agent goes to login page http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php.  From here the agent can access all the help desk tickets that have been assigned to them.

<p>
It is at the same login page that tickets can be assigned by the admin to the appropriate agent and  SLA can be set.  Here you will also see the thread of communications that have already transpired as well as the status of the ticket.  Tickets are kept open until there is a final resolution to the problem.
